### **Assignment 3: Control Structures**

**Objective:** Implement conditional statements and loops.

**Tasks:**

1. **If-Else Statement:**
    - Write a program to check if a number is positive, negative, or zero.
2. **Switch Statement:**
    - Create a simple calculator that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division based on user input.
3. **For Loop:**
    - Print the first 10 natural numbers.
4. **While Loop:**
    - Calculate the factorial of a number provided by the user.
5. **Do-While Loop:**
    - Implement a menu-driven program that repeats until the user chooses to exit.




    **Explanation:**

1. **If-Else Statement:** Checks whether a number is positive, negative, or zero and prints the result.
2. **Switch Statement:** Acts as a simple calculator that performs operations based on user input.
3. **For Loop:** Iterates from 1 to 10, printing natural numbers.
4. **While Loop:** Calculates the factorial of a user-provided number using a while loop.
5. **Do-While Loop:** Implements a menu-driven program that continues to prompt the user until they choose to exit.
